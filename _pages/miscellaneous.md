I like things that are fast in general: 
- Fast (graph) algorithms
- Sports: running, cycling, swimming(I used to be a competitive swimmer), skiing(beginner), and probably more
- Karting(beginner) and Formula One: I'm a fan of Guanyu Zhou, a Chinese racing driver  who currently competes for Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber, and Max Verstappen
- Starship and other rockets
- High performance computing

Meanwhile, I am also interested in some card games, such as riichi mahjong and Texas hold 'em poker: maintain a balanced strategy to protect your equity, and maximize your profit by exploiting opponents' imbalances.

Here's a glance at some of the other things I've been involving in outside of my primary academic focus:

## Sports

Outside of the academic world, I have a passion for triathlons. They provide a great way to stay fit and challenge myself physically and mentally. Here are some of my personal bests:
- Triathlon: None
- Swimming:  
  - 50m breaststroke: 37"44 (&#129351;<span style="color:gold">*1st place*</span> of group B[^1] at the Tsinghua University Swimming Competition, 2021)
  - 100m breaststroke: 1'32"04 (<span style="color:black">*5th place*</span> of group B at the Tsinghua University Swimming Competition, 2023)
  - 50m freestyle: 31"40 (<span style="color:black">*4th place*</span> of group B at the Tsinghua University Swimming Competition, 2021)
  - 200m individual medley: 3'37"03 (&#129352;<span style="color:silver">*2nd place*</span> of group B at the Tsinghua University Swimming Competition, 2020)
- Cycling: None
- Running:
  - 1km: 3:51
  - 5km: 24:42
  - Half marathon: 2:13:48

[^1]: Departments and schools are divided into two groups based on the numbers of students of them. IIIS has a few students, so it is in group B.

Besides, I'm also a beginner in skiing and diving (I mean, jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard).
